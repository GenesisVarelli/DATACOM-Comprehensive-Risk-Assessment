# APT34 (OilRig/HelixKitten)  

## Overview  

APT34, also known as OilRig or HelixKitten, is a state-sponsored cyber espionage group that has been active since at least 2014. It is believed to operate out of Iran and has been linked to Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The group mainly focuses on cyber espionage, targeting organisations across different industries.  

## Nation-State Association  

APT34 is widely believed to be associated with the Iranian government. Cybersecurity researchers have linked the group to the IRGC, which plays a key role in Iran's cyber operations.  

## Targeted Industries  

APT34 mainly focuses on:  

- Energy  
- Finance  
- Telecommunications  
- Government agencies  

Their operations primarily target organisations in the Middle East and the United States. The group's main goal is to collect sensitive information for intelligence purposes.  

## Motives  

APT34’s primary objective is cyber espionage. The group aims to steal sensitive information such as:  

- Intellectual property  
- Financial data  
- Government secrets  

These activities are believed to support Iran’s strategic interests.  

## Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)  

APT34 uses a range of tactics to infiltrate and persist within networks. Some of their known TTPs include:  

- **Spear-phishing** – Sending targeted phishing emails to compromise user credentials  
- **Social engineering** – Manipulating individuals into revealing sensitive information  
- **Malware delivery** – Using malicious websites to distribute malware  
- **Password spraying** – Attempting commonly used passwords across multiple accounts  
- **Custom malware** – Deploying tools like **POWRUNER**, a backdoor used for persistence and data exfiltration  
- **Living-off-the-land techniques** – Using legitimate tools to avoid detection  

Once inside a network, APT34 maintains persistence using command-and-control (C2) infrastructure and various stealth techniques.  

## Defensive Measures  

Organisations can implement several security measures to defend against APT34’s tactics:  

1. **Employee training** – Regular cybersecurity awareness training helps employees identify phishing and social engineering attacks.  
2. **Multi-factor authentication (MFA)** – Adding MFA makes it harder for attackers to access accounts, even if credentials are stolen.  
3. **Endpoint protection** – Deploying antivirus and anti-malware solutions can help detect and block malicious activity.  
4. **Network segmentation** – Dividing the network into isolated segments can limit the spread of malware in case of a breach.  
5. **Incident response plan** – Having a well-defined response plan ensures quick detection and mitigation of threats.  

By implementing these security controls, organisations can improve their resilience against APT34 and similar threats.
