# Risk Assessment for Client

## 1. Define the Context

The client has several important assets that need protection, including:

- **Sensitive Information**: This includes things like business strategies and confidential data.
- **Customer Data**: Personal and financial details of customers.
- **Financial Information**: The client’s accounts, transactions, and financial records.
- **Reputation**: The company’s image and trust with customers and partners.

## 2. Define the Risk Matrix

Here’s how we can classify the likelihood and consequences of potential risks:

| Risk Level | Likelihood (L) | Consequence (C) | Risk Rating (R) |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Low        | 1-2            | 1-2             | Low (1-4)       |
| Moderate   | 3              | 3               | Moderate (6-9)  |
| High       | 4-5            | 4-5             | High (12-25)    |

## 3. Define Three Risk Scenarios

1. **Cyberattack (e.g., Data Breach)**: An external attacker trying to steal sensitive data.
2. **Employee Negligence**: Employees accidentally exposing data through mistakes like clicking on phishing emails.
3. **Physical Break-in**: Someone physically entering the premises and compromising the security systems.

## 4. Assess Risk Rating for Each Risk Scenario (Without Existing Measures)

1. **Cyberattack**:
   - Likelihood: High (5) – Cyberattacks happen regularly, so the chance of this happening is quite high.
   - Consequence: Very High (5) – A successful attack could result in a major data breach and damage the company’s reputation.
   - **Risk Rating** = 5 × 5 = **25** (High)

2. **Employee Negligence**:
   - Likelihood: Moderate (3) – Employees making mistakes is fairly common.
   - Consequence: High (4) – Mistakes could lead to important data being exposed or compromised.
   - **Risk Rating** = 3 × 4 = **12** (Moderate)

3. **Physical Break-in**:
   - Likelihood: Moderate (3) – While less common, break-ins could still happen.
   - Consequence: High (4) – If someone gets in, it could lead to loss or theft of assets.
   - **Risk Rating** = 3 × 4 = **12** (Moderate)

---

## 5. Assess Risk Rating for Each Risk Scenario With Existing Measures (Fence and Padlock)

1. **Cyberattack**:
   - Likelihood: Still High (5) – The fence and padlock don’t protect against cyberattacks.
   - Consequence: Very High (5) – The impact of a data breach would still be severe.
   - **Current Risk Rating** = 5 × 5 = **25** (High)

2. **Employee Negligence**:
   - Likelihood: Low (2) – The fence and padlock help, but employees are still a potential risk for mistakes.
   - Consequence: High (4) – Employee negligence can still lead to significant issues.
   - **Current Risk Rating** = 2 × 4 = **8** (Moderate)

3. **Physical Break-in**:
   - Likelihood: Low (2) – With the fence and padlock, unauthorized access becomes more difficult.
   - Consequence: Moderate (3) – It would still have an impact, but less so than if there were no physical security measures.
   - **Current Risk Rating** = 2 × 3 = **6** (Moderate)

## 6. Assess Risk Levels for Each Risk Scenario With Additional Measures

1. **Cyberattack**:
   - Adding firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), regular software updates, and security training for staff would lower the risk of a cyberattack.
   - **Likelihood**: Moderate (3) – With those measures, the chance of a successful attack is lower.
   - **Consequence**: High (4) – The impact of an attack would still be significant.
   - **Target Risk Rating** = 3 × 4 = **12** (Moderate)

2. **Employee Negligence**:
   - Additional measures could include stronger access controls, more regular training, and a zero-trust policy.
   - **Likelihood**: Low (2) – These measures would reduce human error significantly.
   - **Consequence**: Moderate (3) – Even with training, mistakes can still happen.
   - **Target Risk Rating** = 2 × 3 = **6** (Low)

3. **Physical Break-in**:
   - Additional measures like installing cameras, motion detectors, and alarms would make physical security much stronger.
   - **Likelihood**: Very Low (1) – With these new measures, it would be very hard for someone to break in.
   - **Consequence**: Low (2) – The potential impact would be minimal with these added security measures.
   - **Target Risk Rating** = 1 × 2 = **2** (Low)

## 7. Risk Assessment Report Summary

- **Cyberattack**: The risk remains high without any technical protections. However, by adding firewalls, IDS, and employee training, the risk can be reduced to moderate.
- **Employee Negligence**: With existing measures, the risk is moderate. However, by adding stricter access controls and more frequent training, the risk can be brought down to low.
- **Physical Break-in**: The current security measures reduce the risk to moderate. Adding more physical security systems like cameras and alarms would lower the risk to a minimal level.

---

## Conclusion and Recommendations

- **Cyberattack**: Implement technical controls like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and regular security awareness training to reduce the risk.
- **Employee Negligence**: Strengthen access control policies, conduct regular security awareness training, and consider a zero-trust approach.
- **Physical Break-in**: Enhance physical security with cameras, motion sensors, and alarms to reduce the likelihood of a break-in.
